Go About Tomcat Docker image
============================

This is the Git repo of the Go About Docker image for
[Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), based on the
[Tomcat 7 / JRE 7 official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat/).

We use
[jcassee/parameterized-entrypoint](https://github.com/jcassee/parameterized-entrypoint)
to process templates before starting Tomcat.
